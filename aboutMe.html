                <p>Hi, I am Connor </p>
                <p>I was born in Sydney, Australia and grew up in Weston, Connecticut.  
                    At Northwestern University I am majoring in Computer Science as well as swim on the Menâ€™s Swim and Dive Team. 
                </p>
                <p>I have been swimming since I was six years old.  I am passionate about the sport and racing which has taught me the importance of determination and perseverance.  
                    Swimming has provided me the opportunity to connect with a community of fellow athletes and coaches from all over the world.  
                    I have also had the experience to be part of a team and compete at the highest level. 
                    My greatest achievements have been to compete at the 2021 US Olympic Team Trials as well as several other National meets. 
                 </p>
                <p>The skills I have developed and the lessons I have learned in the pool are ones that I have been able to apply to my academics in the classroom. 
                     As an enthusiastic learner and problem solver, I am eager to 
                     accept a challenge while seeking different methods to improve and innovate.</p>
                <p>
                    Outside of swimming and school, you can find me fishing, exploring hiking trails, or watching Harry Potter Movies!
